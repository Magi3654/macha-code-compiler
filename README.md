### 안녕하세요 to Macha !!

Macha code is a new programming language with a general purpose of high-level design and inspired by the Korean language to be simple for learning for new programmers, the development is thought to be used to create desktop apps.

This language has an understanding of the basic rules of programming, such as declarations, assignation of variables, and printing the value of each one. The particularity of this language is writing on the Romanization of Korean words so if you love the Korean culture and the language Macha you will love it.

### Getting Started 시작! 

To start coding on **Macha** you need to know these basics:
 
- All instructions on **Macha** are written on separated lines
- The variables need to have the data type defined

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Configure your compiler of Macha Code

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
